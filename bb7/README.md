# Claimed BB(7) champion: a transcript grammar, and a Coq proof that it halts

Machine (found by Jeff Ketchersid, October 2026; the BusyBeaverWiki lists its
bound as not independently verified):

    1RB0RG_1RC1RB_0RD1RZ_0LE0LD_0LF1LE_1RA1LF_1LC0RB

This folder describes what the run is made of, and proves in Coq that the
machine **halts** from a blank tape (`BB7Halts.v`, see below). It does **not**
verify the claimed bound, and it does not give the halting time.

## In short

One digit per step (`2*state + symbol`, written `0-9` then `a b c d`).
After a fixed start of 319 digits the run is one move, repeated:

    1^P 0^(2j) 1^Z ...   becomes   (1100)^(j-1) 1^(3P+8-2j) 00 1^(Z-2) ...

- Gap of 2 (`j = 1`): `P` becomes `3P + 6`. This is the tripling.
- Larger gap: new `1100` units appear in front and the old `P` becomes a counter.
- When a block is used up, two gaps join, and the growth goes up one level.
- **The gate.** When the block is a single `1`: `P` even halts; `P` odd (and
  the `1` is the last cell) restarts with `(3P-1)/2` fresh units. The real run
  meets the gate once with `P = 13` (restart, 19 units). After that everything
  stays even, so the next single `1`, the last cell of the tape, is the halt.

The notes ([`bb7_grammar_notes.pdf`](bb7_grammar_notes.pdf)) give the words,
the rule, the tests and the open questions.

## Files

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `bb7_grammar.py` | Writes the digits from the grammar alone. `python3 bb7_grammar.py 100000` prints digits; add `--check` to compare with the machine. |
| `BB7Moves.v` | Coq 8.18, no axioms, about 3 seconds. |
| `bb7_grammar_notes.pdf`, `.tex` | Working notes. |

## Tested (not proofs)

- The grammar equals the machine on the first 60,000,000 digits.
- Single moves, `P = 2..15` odd and even, gaps 2 to 12: 756 of 756 match.
- Complete small runs to the halt: 169 of 169 identical.

## Proved in Coq (`BB7Moves.v`)

| Name | Statement |
| --- | --- |
| `move` | The move above, for all `P`, `j >= 1`, `Z >= 2`, whenever `m = 3P + 3 - 2j >= 1` |
| `wcost_closed` | It takes exactly `3P² + 27P + 44 + 2j + (2j-1)(2m + 2j + 8)` steps |
| `triple` | `j = 1`: `P -> 3P + 6` in `3P² + 33P + 58` steps |
| `chain`, `tri_closed` | `n` triplings in a row; `P` ends as `(P+3)·3^n - 3` |
| `halts_gen` | The gate: `P` even and a single last `1` halts the machine |
| `start` | Blank tape to the clean shape at step 3,954 (`P = 16`, 19 units) |
| `at_5656` | The tape at step 5,656 (`P = 12`, counter 50) |
| `tripling_chain` | After 25 triplings: `P = 15·3^25 - 3`, gap 6, 18 units left |

The step in `tripling_chain` is `5656 + chcost 25 12`, which is
60,572,642,711,595,382,146,057,206 (computed outside Coq from the same formula).

## Not proved

- (Now proved in `BB7Halts.v`: the run stays inside the rule until the gate,
  and the machine halts.)
- The exact halting time and the number of ones left.
- The restart for general odd `P`.
- The digit strings themselves (the step counts equal their lengths).
- The claimed bound.

## Is the grammar closed?

Closed means: every tape shape the run can reach is covered by one of the
rules (move, restart, halt), so the digits can be written without the machine
all the way to the end.

`check_closure.py` follows shapes instead of numbers (the numbers become far
too large). It uses only what the rules look at: the gap, whether a counter is
1, 2 or more, and whether P is large enough for the gap. Run for smaller
versions of the real tape (the real one has 19 units after the restart):

| Units | Shapes reached | Widest gap j | Ends in | Shapes with no rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 4 | 2 | halt, j = 3 | none |
| 2 | 15 | 3 | halt, j = 4 | none |
| 3 | 50 | 4 | halt, j = 5 | none |
| 6 | 1,451 | 7 | halt, j = 8 | none |
| 9 | 39,356 | 10 | halt, j = 11 | none |
| 12 | 1,062,869 | 13 | halt, j = 14 | none |

(All values from 1 to 12 were run; the pattern is the same in each.)

- Every version is closed, and each ends in exactly one halt.
- The widest gap is always units + 1, and the halt comes at units + 2.
  For the real run that is j = 20 and a halt at j = 21.
- P = 2 only ever meets gap 2. P = 12 only meets gap 4. Every wider gap is
  met by P of at least 42, which is enough for gaps up to j = 64.
- After the one restart P is always even and every counter except the last 1
  is even, so the restart never fires again and the last 1 gives the halt.

`check_wide_gaps.py`: the move word W(P, j) and the halt word H(P, j) match
the machine digit for digit for every j from 1 to 21 (63 of 63 each).

The real 19-unit case has about 2.3 billion shapes by the pattern, too many to
list this way. The induction that closes it is in `BB7Halts.v` (next section).

## The machine halts (proved in Coq)

`BB7Halts.v` (Coq 8.18, standard library only, no axioms; needs `BB7Moves.v`):

    Theorem champion_halts : exists n, state (steps n c0) = Hlt.

`c0` is the blank tape in state A. So the claimed BB(7) champion halts.

    coqc BB7Moves.v      # about 7 seconds
    coqc BB7Halts.v      # about 2 seconds, prints "Closed under the global context"

| Theorem | What it says |
|---|---|
| `consume` | for gap widths 1 to 199: a counter behind the gap is used up, the next gap grows by 2j, and the new block is even and large enough |
| `units_halt` | a clean tape with an even block of at least 12, a double gap, 1 to 197 units and the last 1 halts |
| `champion_gate` | from a blank tape the run reaches one block, a gap of 42 cells (width 21) and the last 1 |
| `champion_halts` | from a blank tape the machine halts |

The proof is an induction on the gap width. `bb7_halting_induction.pdf`
(5 pages) explains it in plain words and also gives the last block as a ladder
of functions:

    G_1(P) = 3P + 6
    G_j(P) = G_(j-1) applied (3P + 8 - 2j)/2 times to p_(j-1)
    p_1 = 2,  p_k = G_(k-1)(p_(k-1))
    last block = G_20(G_19(... G_2(16)))

What is **not** in Coq: the exact value of the last block (the formula above is
proved on paper and tested by `check_induction.py`), the halting time, the
number of ones left, and any comparison with the claimed bound. We also do not
know whether this proof is already known to the discoverer or to others.

`check_induction.py` tests the paper formulas: the consume lemma against the
exact rules (10 of 10 small cases), and the whole theorem against the real
machine for one-unit tapes (halts at step 18,310,165 and at step
13,318,711,129, exactly as predicted). `run_tape.c` is the fast machine run it
uses.

## Next: designing a machine from parts

`design/` holds working notes and search code for building a BB(7) machine
part by part (loop, fuel, gate, restart) instead of searching whole tables.
Start with `design/README.md`. No bigger machine has been found yet; the best
designed machine so far is predicted to halt after about 5.5 × 10^328 steps
(not proved, and tiny next to the claimed champion).
